//
//  Summary:  st::Everything is a static class which essentially acts as the main() routine for 
//			  a ST_Anything application.
//			  -All st::Device type objects (Sensors and Executors) are managed by st::Everything.  
//			  -It calls the correct functions within each object it 
//			   is responsible for at the proper time.  
//			  -It handles all initialization of and use of the SmarThings Shield library.
//			  
//			  User-definable settings which will impact the st::Everything class are stored in 
//			  Constants.h.  Please edit Constants.h to adjust these settings.
//
//			  In general, this file should not need to be modified.   
//
//  Change History:
//
//    Date        Who            What
//    ----        ---            ----
//    2015-01-03  Dan & Daniel   Original Creation
//	  2015-01-10  Dan Ogorchock	 Minor improvements to support Door Control Capability
//	  2015-03-14  Dan Ogorchock	 Added public setLED() function to control ThingShield LED
//    2015-03-28  Dan Ogorchock  Added throttling capability to sendStrings to improve success rate of ST Cloud getting the data ("SENDSTRINGS_INTERVAL" is in CONSTANTS.H)
//    2017-02-07  Dan Ogorchock  Added support for new SmartThings v2.0 library (ThingShield, W5100, ESP8266)
//    2019-02-09  Dan Ogorchock  Add update() call to Executors in support of devices like EX_Servo that need a non-blocking mechanism
//    2019-02-24  Dan Ogorchock  Added new special callOnMsgRcvd2 callback capability. Allows recvd string to be manipulated in the sketch before being processed by Everything.
//    2019-07-01  Dan.t		 Added support for websocket Logging, st::debugPrint and st::debugPrintln
