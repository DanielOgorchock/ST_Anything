//
//  Summary:  This file contains a number of user-definable settings that affect the 
//			  ST_Anything library.  This is the main file where user specific settings
//			  should be made to adjust the behavior of SmartThings Shield communications.
//
//	Notes:
//		-The SmartThings Shield uses Pins 0,1 or Pins 2,3 for serial communications based
//		 on the user selectable switch on the shield.
//		-The SmartThings Shield reserves Pin 6 as well.  Best to avoid using it.
//		-The Arduino UNO R3 defaults to using the SoftwareSerial library since the UNO has
//		 only one Hardware UART port ("Serial") which is used by the USB port for 
//		 programming and debugging typically.  
//		-You can use Hardware Serial with an UNO or Leonardo if desired, but you must suppress 
//		 all "Serial.Print()" calls in your sketch, and make sure your Serial.begin() call 
//		 is suppressed or set to use 2400 baud.
//		-Arduino MEGA defaults to using the MEGA's "Serial3" Hardware UART serial port.
//		 This port uses pins 14(Tx) and 15(Rx).  Wire Pin14 to Pin2 and Pin15 to Pin3. 
//		 Be certain to not use Pins 2 & 3 in your Arduino sketch since they are still
//		 electrically connected to the ThingShield.
//		-The SoftwareSerial library has the following known limitations: 
//			-If using multiple software serial ports, only one can receive data at a time.
//			- Not all pins on the Mega and Mega 2560 support change interrupts, so only 
//			  the following can be used for RX: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 50, 51, 52, 53, 
//			  A8(62), A9(63), A10(64), A11(65), A12(66), A13(67), A14(68), A15(69).
//			- Not all pins on the Leonardo and Micro support change interrupts, so only 
//			  the following can be used for RX : 8, 9, 10, 11, 14 (MISO), 15 (SCK), 16 (MOSI).
//    
//  Change History:
//
//    Date        Who            What
//    ----        ---            ----
//    2015-01-03  Dan & Daniel   Original Creation
//    2015-03-28  Dan Ogorchock  Change the default DEV_REFRESH_INTERVAL to 300 seconds.  Was interfering with normal operations.
//                               Added SENDSTRINGS_INTERVAL to throttle the rate at which data is sent to the ThingShield.  Events were being missed.
//                               Added DISABLE_REFRESH feature - commented out by default.  Allows user to disable the automatic refresh feature as it can interfere with normal operations.
//                               Adjusted MAX Sensor and Executor counts for the Arduino MEGA to allow 16 relay system to function properly.
//    2016-06-04  Dan Ogorchock  Added improved support for Arduino Leonardo
