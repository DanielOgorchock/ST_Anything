**NOTE** - HubDuino v1.1.9 was tested using Arduino IDE 1.8.16 + ESP32 v2.0.3

**Recent History:**
- 2022-05-28 HubDuino v1.1.9 - Fixed compiler errors when using ESP8266 3.0.2 and ESP32 2.0.3 board support packages
- 2019-09-14 HubDuino v1.1.7 - Significant changes to the Parent Drivers.  MAC Address is no longer required - only the IP address/port of the micro-controller is needed.  Added Presence Capability to the Parent Device - This indicates whether or not the device has had an update from the microcontroller within a user selectable timeout period via a new setting.  NumberOfButtons setting is removed as it now auto-populates.  This release also requires an update to the ST_Anything library's IS_Button.cpp file.
- 2019-08-17 HubDuino v1.1.6 - Added support for Arduino NANO33IoT
- 2019-06-28 HubDuino v1.1.5 - Added support for MKR1010, Arduino 1.8.9, ESP8266 v2.5.2, updated numerous libraries, etc...

Note: Attempting to use all of these at once on an Arduino UNO R3 is likely to result in running out of SRAM on the UNO (the UNO only has 2 kilobytes of RAM.)  Using an Arduino MEGA 2560 with 8 kilobytes of SRAM is recommended if you want to run everything at once.  The ESP8266, ESP32, and MKR1000, MKR1010, NANO33IoT platforms also have a lot more memory available.

  - + a few more based of user requests
- The ST_Anything Arduino libraries + required 3rd party libraries
- The SmartThings libraries - A modified, more efficient version, now with added support for LAN-to-Hub based communications too! 
- The HubDuino Parent + Child Drivers that support sketches above.
  - hubduino-parent-ethernet.groovy (LAN-to-Hub, - automagically creates child devices based on your Arduino sketch,Arduino/W5100/W5500, Arduino/ESP-01, NodeMCU ESP8266-12e, ESP-01, ESP32, MKR1000, MKR1010, NANO33IoT)
  - hubduino-parent-thingshield.groovy (Thingshield-to-Hub - automagically creates child devices based on your Arduino sketch)
  - child-xxxxxx.groovy (get these from the ST_Anything HubDuino folder at https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/ST_Anything/tree/master/HubDuino/Drivers)
    - currently 24 child device handlers are available!

## Pre-Requisites for using LAN-to-HUB Ethernet connectivity (Arduino/W5100, Arduino/W5500, Arduino/ESP-01, NodeMCU ESP8266, ESP-01, ESP32, MKR1000, MKR1010m NANO33IoT)
- Your Hubitat HUB must have a Reserved/Static TCP/IP Address assigned via your router's DHCP Server. Since this procedure varies by router model, Please Google it!
- ***The Hubitat hub listens on port 39501.  This is different than the ST hub which uses 39500 - MODIFY YOUR ARDUINO SKETCH ACCORDINGLY!***
- You'll need to identify a static TCP/IP address for your Arduino/W5100, Arduino/W5500, Arduino/ESP-01, NodeMCU ESP8266, ESP-01, ESP32, MKR1000, MKR1010, or NANO33IoT as you'll need this later when setting up the sketch. Choose an unused IP address outside of the range your router's DHCP server uses, but in the same subnet.

## Arduino IDE Setup Instructions 
- Download the ST_Anything repository, focusing on the ST_Anything/Arduino/ folders
- This folder structure should mirror that of your local User Arduino directory. 
  - On Mac, it's located in `~/Documents/Arduino/`.
  - On Windows, it's located in `C:\Users\yourusername\Documents\Arduino`.
- Look inside the `Arduino/Sketches` folder of the repo.
- Copy and paste all of the `ST_Anything_...` sketch folders into your local Arduino sketches directory. If you haven't created any sketches, you may not see the folder. In this case, feel free to create it.
- Look inside the `Arduino/libraries` folder of the repo.
- Copy and paste both the `ST_Anything...` and `SmartThings...` folders (as well as ALL of the other library folders) into your local Arduino libraries directory. Many of the devices use third-party libraries which I have included in my repository for conveience/compatibility.
- Open one of the ST_Anything_Multiples_xxxxx.ino sketches for the hardware you're using and see if it successfully compiles.
  - Make sure you select the correct model of board you are compiling for. 
  - If building for a standalone ESP8266 board, make sure you have configured the Arduino IDE to include support for these boards.  Follow the guide at https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp8266-thing-hookup-guide/installing-the-esp8266-arduino-addon
  
**NOTE: Arduino IDE v1.8.9 + v2.5.2 ESP8266 Board support package for the Arduino IDE appears to have corrected the earlier memory leak. Please use this combination of software which has been successfully tested.**  
  
  - If building for a standalone ESP32 board, make sure you have configured the Arduino IDE to include support for these boards.  Follow the guide at https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/README.md
- If using a LAN-to-Hub (WiFi or Cat5 Ethernet) based device
  -Find the lines of the Sketch where it says "<---You must edit this line!"
    - You must ensure your Hubitat hub's LAN IP address does not change.  Use your router's reserved/static DHCP assignment feature to make sure your Hubitat Elevation hub always gets the same IP Address!  Enter that address in the corresponding line in the sketch.
    - ***The Hubitat hub listens on port 39501.  Make sure your Arduino sketch reflects this port number change!***
    - The Arduino must be assigned a static TCP/IP address, Gateway, DNS, Subnet Mask, MAC Address(W5100/W5500 only), SSID+Password(ESP8266,ESP01,ESP32,WiFi101,MKR1000,MKR1010, NANO33IoT)
    - *** NOTE: If using the W5100 Shield, YOU MUST ASSIGN IT A UNIQUE MAC ADDRESS in the sketch! Please leave the first octet in the MAC Address '06' as certain MAC addresses are UNICAST while others are MULTICAST. Your MAC must be UNICAST and be a 'Locally Administered Address' Please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address#Address_details for more information ***
    - *** NOTE: If using the W5500 Shield, YOU MUST ASSIGN IT A UNIQUE MAC ADDRESS in the sketch! Use the one packaged with the W5500 shield.
    - Note: If using an ESP-01 for WiFi-connecticity (i.e. as a WiFi dongle/shield) with an Arduino, the example assumes you're using an Arduino MEGA 2560. Attach the ESP-01 to Hardware Serial "Serial1" and make sure your ESP01 has current 'AT Firmware' installed.
  - Your IDE Serial Monitor Window must be set to 115200 baud  **** Please note recent change to 115200 ****
  - With the Serial Monitor window open, load your sketch and watch the output
  - The MAC Address will be printed out in the serial monitor window. Write this down as you will need it to configure the Device using your web browser connected to the Hubitat hub. (Note: MAC Address must later be entered with no delimeters (i.e. NO COLONS!) in the form of "06AB23CD45EF" (all UPPERCASE and without quotes!))

WARNING:  If you are using an Arduino UNO, you may need to comment out some of the devices in the sketch (in the setup() function) due to the UNO's limited 2 kilobytes of SRAM.  Failing to do so will most likely result in unpredictable behavior. The Arduino MEGA 2560 has 8k of SRAM and has four Hardware Serial ports (UARTs).  If you plan on using many devices, get an Arduino MEGA 2560, a MKR1000, a MKR1010, a NANO33IoT, a NodeMCU v1.0 ESP8266-12e, or a ESP32 board.

## Hubitat Elevation Hub Setup Instructions
- Using your Web Browser (Chrome works well) connect to your Hubitat Hub
- Click on "Drivers Code" from the left hand navigation menu
- Click on "+New Driver" button in top right corner
- One at a time, Copy, Paste, and Save the source code for ALL of the "child-*.groovy" and "hubduino-parent-*.groovy" Drivers found in https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/ST_Anything/tree/master/HubDuino/Drivers
- You should now have all of the necessary Hubitat Drivers added to your Hubitat Elevation Hub

Your "Drivers Code" page should now look similar to the following
![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5206084/41035111-a3dbac5e-6959-11e8-963c-60c33a44986c.png)


## HubDuino Parent Ethernet Device Instructions - FOR USE WITH LAN-to-HUB WiFi/Cat5 Ethernet Devices
- Click on "Devices" from the left hand navigation menu
- Click the "+ Add Virtual Device" button in top right corner
- 
- Enter in the following REQUIRED fields
    - Device Name: anything you want (tip: keep it short as this will be the prefix for all Child Devices that are created)
    - Device Label: anything you want (tip: keep it short)
    - Device Network ID: now automatically assigned by Hubitat during this step.  Later will be overwritten with the Arduino IP address in hexadecimal.
    - Type: "HubDuino Parent Ethernet"

Your screen should look like the following image just before you click Save Device:
![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5206084/64909952-f4863d00-d6df-11e9-9efd-8fa541624ab3.png)

Afterwards, go into the device page of the Parent and enter in the highlighted information for your ST_Anything device

![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5206084/64909953-f7812d80-d6df-11e9-884e-9aa202acfa9f.png)

- Click the SAVE PREFERENCES button at the bottom of the screen.  This will cause a REFRESH command to be sent to your ST_Anything microcontroller, which in turn will send a status update for every device you configured in your sketch's setup() routine.  These updates from ST_Anything will cause child devices to be created if they do not yet exist.
	
## Verify your Child Devices are automagically created	
- Click on "Devices" from the left hand navigation menu
- You should see your "HubDuino Parenr Ethernet" in the list
- For every device you created in your sketch, you see see a corresponding Child Device under the Parent
- Select the "Logs" from the left hand navigation menu to view debug data from the Parent Device and Child Devices




## HubDuino Parent ThingShield Device Instructions - FOR USE WITH A THINGSHIELD
- Join your Arduino/ThingShield to your hub using the hub's "Discover Devices" feature.  It will show up as a generic "Device" or a "SmartThings sensor"
- Click on Devices from navigation menu
- Select your "Arduino ThingShield" device from the list
- Change the Type to "HubDuino Parent ThingShield"
- Click the SAVE button at the bottom of the screen.  This will cause a REFRESH command to be sent to your ST_Anything microcontroller, which in turn will send a status update for every device you configured in your sketch's setup() routine.  These updates from ST_Anything will cause child devices to be created if they do not yet exist.




## Items to be aware of
1) Please do not start changing any code before getting one of the examples up and running on both the Arduino/ESP8266/ESP32 and the Device Handlers.  It is always best to start with known working code before editing it.  This greatly reduces the amount of troubleshooting later.

2) Hubitat now supports Composite (i.e. Parent/Child) Device Drivers.  The Parent Device takes care of creating, updating, and deleting child devices
  - Assuming you're keeping things fairly standard, you should never need to modify the groovy code within the Parent / Child Drivers!  Pretty much all changes are kept within the Arduino Sketch .ino file!
  - Child Devices are automatically created by the HubDuino Parent Device - no manual creation of Virtual Devices
  - If you delete the HubDuino Parent Device, all of its children are also deleted.  PLEASE NOTE that you can simply delete any child device individually if necessary (no need to delete the Parent Device!)  If the Arduino sketch no longer sends updates for those child devices, they will not be re-created.
  - You can add additional devices to the Arduino sketch at a later date.  Doing so will cause the Parent Device to automagically create the new child devices once data from the Arduino sketch makes its way to the Hubitat hub.  If you remove a device from your sketch, you will need to manually remove the child device from your Hubitat hub.
  - You can rename any of the Child Devices via the Hubitat web IDE as you see fit.  Just select a Child Device, and simply change its "Device Label" field and click save.  
  - Do NOT change the Child Devices' Device Network ID - The HubDuino Parent Driver uses this field to link the Child device to the Parent device

3) The names of the devices you create in the Arduino setup() routine MUST MATCH EXACTLY the names the HubDuino Parent Driver code expects.  The names are CaSe SenSiTiVe!  Do not get creative with naming in the Arduino sketch as the Child Devices will not be created.  Follow the naming convention as seen in the "ST_Anything_Multiples_xxxx.ino" sketches
  - Contact Sensors:  "contact1", "contact2", "contact3", ...
  - Alarm: "alarm1", "alarm2", "alarm3", ...
  - Motion: "motion1", "motion2", "motion3", ...
  - Smoke Detectors: "smoke1", "smoke2", "smoke3", ...
  - Switch: "switch1", "switch2", "switch3", ...
  - Dimmer Switch: "dimmerSwitch1", "dimmerSwitch2", "dimmerSwitch3", ...
  - RGB Switch: "rgbSwitch1", "rgbSwitch2", "rgbSwitch3", ...
  - RGBW Switch: "rgbwSwitch1", "rgbwSwitch2", "rgbwSwitch3", ...
  - Door Control: "doorControl1", "doorControl2", "doorControl3", ...
  - Water Sensor: "water1", "water2", "water3", ...
  - CO Detector: "carbonMonoxide1", "carbonMonoxide2", "carbonMonoxide3", ...
  - Button: "button1", "button2", "button3", ...
  - Illuminance: "illuminance1", "illuminance2", "illuminance3", ...
  - Voltage: "voltage1", "voltage2", "voltage3", ...
  - Power: "power1", "power2", "power3", ...
  - Energy: "energy1", "energy2", "energy3", ...
  - RelaySwitch: "relaySwitch1", "relaySwitch2", "relaySwitch3", ...
  - Temperature: "temperature1", "temperature2", "temperature3", ...
  - Humidity: "humidity1", "humidity2", "humidity3", ...
  - Servo: "servo1", "servo2", "servo3", ...
  - ***Special Case*** DHT22 Temp/Humid: "temphumid1" along with last two arguments being "temperature1" and "humidity1", ... 
  - ***Special Case*** DS18B20 Temperature: "temperature1" if only one sensor, "temperature" if using multiples as the 1, 2, 3 will be auto added to the end of the name
  
4) If you are using a W5100 Ethernet Shield with an Arduino, the MAC address must start with '06' in order to be sure you're using a ***locally administered unicast MAC address***.  Make sure that you have unique MAC addresses if you use more than one W5100 on your network.

5) When entering the MAC address into the Device Preferences in the Hubitat hub parent device web page, ***please be sure to enter it without delimiters (i.e. NO COLONS!), and in UPPERCASE***.  It should be in the form '06AB02CD03EF' without the quotes.  The MAC address will be printed out in the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor window (115200 baud) when the board is restarted.

6) When using a NodeMCU ESP8266 board, you need to be aware of some GPIO limitations.  I have assembled my findings in this image:
![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5206084/26479180/53488d08-419f-11e7-824f-aa1649335c02.png)

7) When using a ESP32 board, you need to be aware of some GPIO limitations
  - GPIO 34-39 are input only and do NOT support internal pullup resistors
  - GPIO  6-11 are reserved for FLASH.  Do not use these!
  - The Arduino analogWrite() function is not supported as of 8/18/2017.  This means the EX_Switch_Dim ST_Anything Class does not support PWM output on the ESP32.

8) Button Devices - "where do they show up?"  Buttons show up in the Apps that use them. When you define the number of buttons (via the HubDuino Parent Device option) you are announcing to all Apps the number of buttons defined.  This in turn allows Apps like "Simple Lighting" and "Rule Machine" to know how many "buttons" to offer you to configure an action.  So, the easiest test is to create a new "Simple Lighting" automation, where you define the action to be based on a button "pushed" or "held" event from the HubDuino Parent Device (no child devices are created for buttons).  Give it a try! I have used this successfully in the past for testing purposes.


## Final Notes for now...
Plese refer to the header files of the ST_Anything library for explanation of specific classes, constructor arguments, etc... ST_Anything devices support inverted logic, default power-on states, debounce logic, etc...  Read through the top section of the .h files found on the libraries\ST_Anything... folders for more information!

Look at the documentation in the 'ST_Anything_Multiples_xxxx.ino' files for explanation and examples of the general use of the library.
